            <h2>UX Redesign: Better UK - An health and gym application</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2.5%;"><a href="uiux.html">< UI/UX</a></p>
            <h3>Product Overview:</h3>
            <p>The Better UK app is a mobile application for users to book activities and buy memberships for Better UK gyms across the country. 
                As a user of this app, I discovered a problem regarding the user interface when first understanding what features were avaliable and where I could find them.

                <img src="images/BUK3.png" alt="Redesign">
            <br>
            <h3>Problem:</h3>
            <p>In the original design, all the options are homogenised in a grid format and can be confusing to distinguish what is what. 
                While the booking options are higher on the page and larger ever so slightly, they repeat the term “Book” and blend in too well with the other grid icons. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>I intended to improve the general user experience of the home page by reducing any clutter to simplify the user interface. 
                By sectioning the major options for the user, it should improve the __ and bring a higher level of openness. I also wanted to bring a modern approach to the UI design. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Tools & Programs Used:</h3>
                <li>Figma Desktop for UI design</li>
                <li>Additional Icon Set by Iconduck for additional symbols</li>
            <br>
            <h3>Goals: </h3>
                <li>Create faster access to view bookings and account options</li>
                <li>Reduce excess text on the home page</li>
                <li>Keep intial visual identity</li>
            <br>
            <h3>Wireframes: </h3>

            <img src="images/BUK2.png" alt="Evolved wireframe Mockup">
            <p>For my initial redesign wireframe, I wanted to keep the original apps visual language but segment the different features more clearly.
                I revised this with update
                </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Final Design:</h3>
            <p>With the final design, I decided to re-organise the order of the Booking and My Account sections as after revaluation, 
                I understood users would come to the app requiring access to the former on a more regular basis than the latter. There is also more
            space on the redesign, giving the user a less cramped experience.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
            <p>For a homepage, good accessibility is important and creating a positive first impression is critical. As the application is meant for many repeat users, the ease-of-access to book activities is significant.
                Overall, I learned what good and bad features the initial design had and understood what to keep and remove to improve its usability.
