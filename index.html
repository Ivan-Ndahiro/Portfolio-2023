                <p style="margin-left: 25%;margin-right: 25%">  I've been interested in Technology, Design, and the combination of the two ever since I was young. Subjects like ICT and DT led me to realize how interesting the topics were and studying CS has helped me fulfill and implement tasks given to me.
                    <br><br>
                    Modules such as HCI 1 & 2 have put me in a team environment with the collaboration and discussion of designs based on the brief showing me the importance of teamwork and communication skills.
                    <br><br>
                    I hope to join a career that will help me constantly improve on my creative skills and learn at a fast pace from professionals in their field, working hard to meet the user's needs.</p>
