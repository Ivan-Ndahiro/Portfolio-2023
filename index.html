                <h2 id="about">About</h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 20%;margin-right: 20%">  I've been interested in Technology, Design, and the combination of the two ever since I was young. Subjects like ICT and DT led me to realize how interesting the topics were and studying CS has helped me fulfill and implement tasks given to me.
                    <br><br>
                    Modules such as HCI 1 & 2 have put me in a team environment with the collaboration and discussion of designs based on the brief showing me the importance of teamwork and communication skills. My experience in Skill Training programs & mentoring an App Development club for the lower senior department of my school has helped me refine these skills, including leadership and problem-solving when issues arise.
                    <br><br>
                    I hope to join a career that will help me enhance my creative skills and learn from professionals in their field to understand how to best work toward a user's needs.</p>
